# The Vault

The Vault is decentralized application allowing users to interact with a collection of NFTs on the blockchain. Users can withdraw a random NFT and donate their own NFT via an ethereum smart contract.

This project demonstrates an understanding of building decentralized applications using React, Solidity, and Hardhat.
I created this project after attending Eth Denver 2022, because I was interested in blockchain development and the web3 space.


Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
